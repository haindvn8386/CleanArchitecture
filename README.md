A modern **Product & Order Management API** built with **.NET 8** using **Microservices Architecture**. This project showcases a scalable and distributed back-end system for managing products and orders, leveraging **Docker** for containerization and **Apache Kafka** for event-driven communication. Hosted on GitHub as part of my portfolio, it demonstrates my expertise in microservices design, containerization, and asynchronous messaging.

## 🏗️Project Overview
This is a back-end project designed as a microservices-based system for managing **products** and **orders**. It consists of two main services: **Product Service** and **Order Service**, communicating asynchronously via Kafka. The project uses .NET 8, Docker for containerization, and SQLite as a lightweight database (configurable for other DBMS). It’s a practical example of modern distributed systems, built to highlight my skills in microservices architecture and DevOps practices.

Goals of this project:
- Demonstrate proficiency in designing and implementing microservices.
- Showcase integration of event-driven architecture with Kafka.
- Highlight containerization skills using Docker.

## 🛠️Features
- **Product Service**: CRUD operations for managing products.
- **Order Service**: Create and retrieve orders, linked to products.
- **Event-Driven Communication**: Uses Kafka to publish and consume events (e.g., order creation triggers stock updates).
- **Containerization**: Services run in Docker containers for easy deployment.
- **Scalability**: Microservices architecture enables independent scaling of services.

## 🗝️Technologies Used
- **.NET 8.0**: Core framework for building microservices.
- **ASP.NET Core**: RESTful API framework for each service.
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for database operations.
- **SQLite**: Lightweight database (swappable to SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.).
- **Docker**: Containerization of services.
- **Apache Kafka**: Message broker for event-driven communication.
- **Confluent.Kafka**: .NET client for Kafka integration.
- **Swagger**: API documentation and testing.

## 🏚️Architecture
The project follows **Microservices Architecture** with the following components:
- **Product Service**: Manages product data (e.g., name, price, stock). Publishes events to Kafka when product stock changes.
- **Order Service**: Handles order creation and retrieval. Consumes events from Kafka to update order status based on product availability.
- **Kafka**: Acts as the message broker for asynchronous communication between services. Topics: `product-stock-updated`, `order-created`.
- **Docker**: Each service runs in its own container, alongside Kafka and Zookeeper.

This architecture ensures loose coupling, scalability, and fault tolerance.

## 💽Setup Instructions
### Prerequisites
- [.NET 8.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/8.0)
